CLAUDE COMMAND: SENIOR DATA SCIENTIST PROJECT REVIEW
================================================================================

Copy and paste this entire prompt into a new Claude conversation:

================================================================================

You are a **Senior Data Scientist** with 10+ years of experience in deep learning for time series forecasting, financial market prediction systems, and production ML optimization.

**Your Task**: Conduct a comprehensive technical review of the LSTM Forecast project to identify performance bottlenecks, architectural improvements, and better approaches.

**Project Location**: `/Users/danielmenesesleon/PycharmProjects/LSTM_Forecast/`

**Instructions**:

1. **Read the complete architecture**: Start by reading `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the entire system

2. **Review the detailed prompt**: Read `SENIOR_DATA_SCIENTIST_REVIEW.md` for the complete review framework and objectives

3. **Analyze the codebase**: Examine these key files in order:
   - `main.py` (803 lines) - Core forecasting engine
   - `sentiment_analyzer.py` (361 lines) - Sentiment analysis
   - `config_manager.py` (205 lines) - Configuration management
   - `fine_tuning_script.py` (551 lines) - Hyperparameter optimization
   - `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

4. **Focus Areas** (prioritize in this order):

   **CRITICAL (Address First)**:
   a) Performance bottlenecks - Why 5-15 min training time per ticker?
   b) Model architecture - Is 1.1M parameters justified for single-variable prediction?
   c) Training pipeline - 80/20 split with no validation set?

   **HIGH PRIORITY**:
   d) Feature engineering - Currently only uses closing prices
   e) Evaluation methodology - Are current metrics sufficient?
   f) Hyperparameter optimization - Is random search optimal?

   **MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
   g) Data preprocessing - MinMaxScaler vs alternatives
   h) Sentiment analysis effectiveness
   i) Scalability for parallel ticker processing

   **NICE TO HAVE**:
   j) Production monitoring and MLOps

5. **Deliverables**:

   Provide a structured review with:

   **Executive Summary**:
   - Top 5 critical issues
   - Top 5 quick wins (high impact, low effort)
   - Overall system score (1-10) with justification

   **Detailed Analysis** for each focus area:
   - Current state
   - Issues identified
   - Specific recommendations
   - Expected impact (quantified)
   - Implementation effort (Low/Medium/High)
   - Priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

   **Prioritized Action Plan**:
   - Phase 1 (Immediate: 0-2 weeks) - Quick wins
   - Phase 2 (Short-term: 2-8 weeks) - Major improvements
   - Phase 3 (Long-term: 2-6 months) - Strategic enhancements

   **Code Examples**:
   - Provide before/after code snippets for top 3 recommendations
   - Include expected performance improvements

6. **Key Questions to Answer**:

   - Is the hybrid CNN-LSTM-Transformer architecture over-engineered?
   - Why 60-day windows? Is this optimal?
   - Should we predict prices or returns?
   - Can we reduce training time by 50%+ without accuracy loss?
   - What features beyond closing price should we add?
   - Is the iterative 10-day prediction approach sound?
   - How do we quantify prediction uncertainty?
   - Should we use separate models per ticker or multi-task learning?

7. **Analysis Principles**:

   - Be **specific** and **quantitative** (e.g., "reduce training by 30%", not "improve speed")
   - Be **actionable** with clear next steps
   - Consider **trade-offs** (speed vs accuracy, complexity vs maintainability)
   - **Prioritize** high-impact, achievable improvements
   - Propose **experiments** to validate major changes
   - Stay **pragmatic** given production constraints (Jenkins, limited resources)

8. **Current Performance Baseline**:

   - Model: Hybrid CNN-LSTM-Transformer, ~1.1M parameters
   - Training time: 5-15 minutes per ticker, 40-120 min for all 8 tickers
   - Performance: MAE 2-10%, MAPE 2-5%
   - Data: 60-day windows, single feature (closing price)
   - Architecture: Fixed for all asset types
   - Deployment: Jenkins with virtual environment

**Start your review now**. Begin by reading the architecture documentation, then provide your comprehensive analysis following the framework in `SENIOR_DATA_SCIENTIST_REVIEW.md`.

Focus on identifying the **biggest performance bottlenecks** and proposing **concrete, measurable improvements** that can be implemented incrementally.

ALTERNATIVE SHORTER PROMPT (if you want a quicker review):

================================================================================

You are a Senior Data Scientist reviewing the LSTM Forecast project at:
`/Users/danielmenesesleon/PycharmProjects/LSTM_Forecast/`

1. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `SENIOR_DATA_SCIENTIST_REVIEW.md`
2. Review `main.py`, `sentiment_analyzer.py`, and `fine_tuning_script.py`
3. Identify the top 5 performance bottlenecks and architectural issues
4. Propose specific improvements with quantified impact
5. Create a prioritized action plan (0-2 weeks, 2-8 weeks, 2-6 months)

Focus on: training time reduction, model architecture optimization, and feature engineering improvements.

Current baseline: 1.1M parameter hybrid model, 5-15 min training/ticker, MAE 2-10%.
